# RBAC Management System

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

I have developed a basic User Management and Role Management system, which includes the following features:

## User Management:  
Users can be created, and their roles can be assigned or updated. Each user has unique attributes like username, email, and role.
## Role Management: 
A system for defining different roles with specific permissions. Roles can be created, deleted, and assigned to users, helping to manage access levels.
## CRUD Operations:
Basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for both users and roles.
## UI: 
The project is built using Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface, allowing easy interaction with the system.
## Security: 
Basic role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can perform actions like creating, editing, or deleting users and roles.

This project was developed within a limited time frame and serves as a foundational structure for user and role management, which can be further expanded with advanced features like permission management, authentication, and more.
